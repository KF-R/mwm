# Mining With Mines '23


This is a reboot of a game I wrote for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in early 1985. 
It's a bit faster, a bit better looking and I had a lot more fun making the
sound effects this time.

You're an astronaut out spelunking on an alien world and you've been charged
with finding the bottom of a seemingly endless crater.

Keys are:
- I Toggle jetpack
- J Left
- K Place a bomb
- L Right

You'll find extra shields, bombs and jet fuel along the way but beware the
flames.

If you sit too still for too long, the timer will get you!
